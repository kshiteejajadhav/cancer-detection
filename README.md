# Cancer Detection using SVM

This project applies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify cell samples as **Benign (2)** or **Malignant (4)** using medical data from `cell_samples.csv`.

---

## Objective
To develop a binary classification model that can assist in the detection of cancerous cells using key biological features.

---

## Dataset
The dataset `cell_samples.csv` contains 9 attributes extracted from cell images:
- Clump Thickness
- Uniformity of Cell Size
- Uniformity of Cell Shape
- Marginal Adhesion
- Single Epithelial Cell Size
- Bare Nuclei
- Bland Chromatin
- Normal Nucleoli
- Mitoses

The `Class` column is the target:
- `2`: Benign
- `4`: Malignant

---

##  How It Works

1. Loads and cleans dataset
2. Extracts features and target variable
3. Trains an SVM (linear kernel)
4. Evaluates using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall

## Results
- Classifier: SVM (Linear Kernel)
- Accuracy: ~`96%` 
- Evaluation:
                     
                       precision   recall  f1-score   support
